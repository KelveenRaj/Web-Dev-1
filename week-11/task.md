# Week 11 Activity: Create Interactive Game Layout

## Task:

1. **Create the Game Files**:

   - Create a folder named `starter`.
   - Inside `starter`, create three files:
     - **index.html** (HTML structure)
     - **styles.css** (CSS for styling)
     - **script.js** (JavaScript for interactivity)

2. **HTML Structure**:

   - Create a file called `index.html` and set up the game layout. Ensure you have a welcome message, input field, buttons, and feedback section.

3. **Add Basic Styling**:

   - Style the game using CSS (`styles.css`). Use the provided example or modify it as needed.

4. **Implement Interactivity**:
   - Write JavaScript code (`script.js`) that listens for button clicks and checks user guesses against a random number. Display feedback accordingly.

## Example Output:

- The webpage should have a clear layout for each section (home, quiz, results).
- Display proper feedback based on user input.
- Include a button that allows users to start a new game after completion.
